The columns should be called `first`, `last`, `truth`, `lie`, and `haircuts`, and there should be one row for each partner. The columns in each row should contain the first and last name of the team member, one odd real-life fact about them (six words or less), one real-life non-fact about them that would be cool if it were true (six words or less), and the approximate estimated number of haircuts the team member has undergone in his/her lifetime.
